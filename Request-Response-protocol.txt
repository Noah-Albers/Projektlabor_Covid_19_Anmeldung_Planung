C sends id
C sends a random nonce
S encryptes nonce
S grabs RSA-Pub for id
S generates AES-Key, S generates AES-IV
S encrypts AES-Key and AES-IV with RSA-Pub for id as CPub(KeyIv)
S sends CPub(KeyIv) to C
C decrypts with RSA-Priv KeyIv
C sends request with KeyIv
S sends reqsponse with KeyIv

AES-Key = 32byte
AES-IV = 16byte

C After a secure connection has been established the client will now start by transfering his request in a json-format (UTF8-Encoded)
S Performs the request and sends back the encrypted nonce and a response
